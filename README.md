# portal-docs
Markdown documentation to be displayed in the Portal. The mapping is simple: `.md` files here are served under `/docs` on the Portal. For example,
[`faq.md`](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/portal-docs/blob/master/faq.md) in this repo
corresponds to [`/docs/faq`](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/docs/faq) in the Portal.

If we rename or consolidate pages, we don't want old links to just 404: We'd prefer that the old URL redirect to the new one.
Redirects can also be configured in this repo: If `/docs/old` should redirect to `/docs/new`,
then the file `old.md` should be replaced by `old.redirect`, which should contain just one line:
```
/docs/new
```
(While Markdown is a general-purpose technology, this way of configuring redirects is specific to the HuBMAP Portal.)

Responsibilities:
- Chris Briggs (Harvard) oversees curation, assay, and metadata related topics and questions.
- Melissa Schwenk (University of Pittsburgh) oversees general consortium and FAQ related topics and questions.

## Deployment details

This repo is included as a git submodule in [`portal-ui`](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/portal-ui):
The documents are included in the JS bundle for the HuBMAP Portal, and rendered on the client-side.

## Requesting typo fixes, content updates or corrections
All requests for documentation edits should be reported to help@hubmapconsortium.org.
Deb Nigra or Megan Carroll will forward these requests directly to Melissa Schwenk who will file each issue in
https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/portal-docs/issues. Melissa will assign each issue to herself & Chris Briggs
who will then triage them and make the requested edits. Edit requests that are deemed significant will be reviewed
by relevant HuBMAP team members.

Release schedule:
- Changes made by Monday 5pm will be 
  - deployed to DEV/TEST/STAGE Tuesday morning,
  - and, if QA passes, on production by Tuesday afternoon.
- Changes made by Wednesday 5pm will be 
  - deployed to DEV/TEST/STAGE Thursday morning,
  - and, if QA passes, on production by Thursday afternoon.

This is the regular schedule: If there are problems with a release, doc updates will be delayed.

## **This shouldn't be where you read the docs!**

If you're here to read documentation, use [the Portal](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/docs/) instead!

This repo is mirrored there, and in that context, the URLS don't include `.md`.
As a consequence, links between documents in here in Github won't work. Besides that, the docs also reference other portions of the site that aren't in this repo at all.
