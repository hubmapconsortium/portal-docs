# HuBMAP CODEX Data

### Last Updated: 6/1/2020

## Overview
This document details CODEX data states, metadata fields, file structure, QA/QC thresholds, and data processing.

## Description
CODEX is a strategy for generating highly multiplexed images of fluorescently-labeled antigens. In brief, antibodies to antigens of interest are labeled with antigen-specific oligonucleotide barcodes. The barcoded antibodies are then applied to a tissue sample where they bind to target antigens. Complementary oligonucleotide probes tagged with fluorophores are then applied to the tissue sample, one antigen-specific probe at a time, allowing hybridization to the barcodes on the target antibodies. An image is captured, the probes are washed off and the process is repeated. Up to 50 protein targets are interrogated, one imaging cycle at a time, allowing generation of a composite image of up to 50 protein targets within a single tissue section.

## Definitions
There are a variety of terms used in this document that may not be familiar to all HubMap users. The following figures illustrate several of these terms:

*Figure 1: Diagram of microscopy terms. The black box represents a slide or cover slip holding the sample. Blue boxes represent “regions” or user-defined imaging areas. For instance, one selects a “region” containing a microstructure of interest to be captured in an image. Red boxes represent “tiles” or the microscope “field of view”. The size of a tile is determined by the microscope settings and objective. An imaging region is divided into contiguous tiles. Because the field of view cannot be changed, tiles will overhang from the region, ensuring the entire region is imaged at the expense of extra tiles being acquired.*

### Antibody Metadata
Each TMC will provide a file listing each antibody name, respective cycle and channel. This metadata file will then inform later processes at the HIVE and be used for labeling. Further, we aim to curate the final antibody list with expert interpretation of redundant names to make antibodies and markers a searchable criteria within the HuBMAP database.

## HuBMAP CODEX Raw File Structure
1.  The general structure of the level 0 (raw) data produced by the Akoya software (HuBMAP data generated by UF & Vanderbilt) and Stanford software is shown in the image below. Stanford employs a modified pipeline. If the HandEstain field in Stanford's **Experiment.json** CODEX data is true, then additional folders are generated for the HandE cycle named as “HandE_reg1”. These are treated as separate cycles.
    
Other differences between CODEX software employed by Stanford versus Akoya proprietary software are documented [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ff7iHRxkiV-DcvznFTCc1sgS_78tHKcm0ohYhv7jLjQ).
 
![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yFfbx7Mj56uBMOFnxtOwKfaPDfmRo9XWoOXDQcTb9YA_91kv7lKSlyCnKld63N8BaWsCDAH_KDz1R56Gl2p2YYfLkTjZRyvBe_t73punyBWh1Vt96CSFapL8tLZucryeZ1BiIqkU)

2.  Segmentation files in the processed data contributed by the TMC’s can be found in the following locations:  
      
Stanford cell segmentation results can be found in the location mentioned below. You can see several text files generated per tile named as tilename-compensated.txt and tilename-uncompensated.txt. In addition to that, FCS and CSV files are stored based on the tiles, which are mainly used for analysis. The masks per tile can be found as .pngs which contain the images of cell boundaries.  
      
The exact same data from Stanford is also available in an image sequence format, which stores the data in the same folder structure as Akoya’s format. But we can ignore this processed dataset with image sequence for analysis purposes.

## HuBMAP QA/QC of raw (state0) data files
1.  Files submitted by the TMC’s will be validated by the TMC in the following steps:
    A) Checked for zero length files
    B) The number of (raw) folders should be equal to the number of cycles * number of regions of interest
   C) The number of image files (TIFF) should be equal to the number of z planes(Z) * number of tiles(X) * number of tiles(Y) * number of channels.
 
If files fail to meet this validation criteria, they will not be submitted to the HIVE.

2.  A cycle for assessing background (“blanks”) should be included in every CODEX experiment. At a minimum, the first cycle should be filled with “blanks” with an additional “blank” cycle for each change in exposure time. [identified in the channel_names file which will be labeled as “Blank”].
    
If no blanks have been included within the CODEX dataset, the recommended action by the HIVE is to reject the dataset.

3) After acquisition of the dataset, the CODEX commercial instrument generates a ".txt" "channelnames" file which lists the marker per channel/per cycle and has the general structure shown below. The operator saves a copy as a “.csv” file named **channelnames_report** and annotates each channel/cycle as described below. 
As shown in this example, DAPI is a DNA-binding fluorescent dye that serves as a control detected in channel 1 for each hybridization cycle (DAPI-01, DAPI-02, etc):

```
DAPI-01
Blank
Blank
Blank
DAPI-02
CD31

### How to read channelnames

*Blank channel* is used to monitor autofluorescence at each channel (wavelength) which typically increases over time and with each cycle.

*Empty channel* indicates a channel (wavelength) that was not used to detect any marker during a specific cycle.

For each dataset, the number of cycles and channels is reported in the experiment.json file:
![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HNpVApDXXGiQvkeEK8xDAxyy6duSetS5Hc9aHQVbaofd7V_pyOPVqWOsa8cYPKsglQF6js669YgkjjxIRnKnPZocPhG-yZw2ytlb7FUPor1i-JPut3K_nFbqXPp8woD9YJvTyubu)

### How to read channelnames_report
The operator annotates each cycle/channel with *TRUE/FALSE* to indicate whether or not the expected signal or absence of signal was detected, i.e. antibody bound to the target protein or the channel was Blank or Empty.

```
DAPI-01, TRUE
Blank, TRUE
Blank, TRUE
Blank, TRUE
DAPI-02, TRUE
CD31, FALSE
CD8, FALSE
Empty, FALSE
DAPI-03, TRUE
CD20, FALSE
Ki67, FALSE
CD3e, FALSE
DAPI-04, TRUE
SMActin, FALSE
Podoplanin, FALSE
CD68, FALSE
DAPI-05, TRUE
PanCK, FALSE
Empty, TRUE
Blank, TRUE
etc......
```

### How to evaluate the channels to create the QA/QC channelnames_report.cvs file
Using commercial version:

1.  Process the data using the processing tool provided by Akoya.
![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TdXb9S_H0e_5gjnEVP0D2kBX39s3DZ7bR1CL9SMTkBwp6omwxM7tFiT54_voUpIoHXcWcPjTJ-JIoQq5mi6WrjS2qLJritRv2N-_eiVBa-kADGDLVR9HUKgJ7HX5gqA5HKf8UfAf)
2.  Generate the Report ppt file by enabling the option at the prompt.
![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/o_gu3Rdk8LEYfnNIsgRNVc3B5R1vL9ZMcIK5X_L8i7HXcrD5OjfdB0Ly2zsQhpZoWvvu-SgfMRNk3d8UIa-7wJZKq130VSg6LVvBqdIbFnGWQyKCknPGth6Ck2FH9rqM4Ptlzlfj)

The Akoya integrated processing step [(go to CODEX help for further information)](https://help.codex.bio/codex/processor/user-instructions/image-analysis-report) produces an **Image Analysis Report** for each region acquired. The report includes the following documentation:
- ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xQNmmUCy09LcKyp4WexCIhpoNi-VojYN4Vm8rr2QHsdcYkrJg1Vgs_Nlp8o-S5eTBsWd_t4CvayUvf_791h_-3feaYrvDWLMmRSNxdN9HEWaY1wpgdeOMDmwSVDUZ5R3nQXiYC-6)
- ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/E0OehUKsXaw14YmwSBn6cYO3XqCcAAjuDYTKoCBpkYzCOfZO4GVx9eJd49pPVZYsS9tNN3EQsitc8lMtAbUlbbnoQQPSBO4G58ctilIljDsWdeJNnfkhsqU35ZyO8PVee0FP43xF)
- ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kK2XRFJ0dMjLmDc5qelOQHAWBrMh7GG734e5epsjDgCTfqwNy824gHpdYZQdPK2g1drSnhdsiIuSvy7_Ra1ezVEuKMBuQvl2Rwxa21iFftnj2sI89YXMh4tC2NjxClBsFzzjbQi)

A histogram and sample image is generated for every acquired channel. Each row is a cycle, containing its corresponding channels. Top-left image and histogram is always the first cycle, first channel. Image and histogram to their right is the same cycle, second channel.

The displayed image is a full-resolution cropped image that has the greatest standard deviation among those sampled. Each image may be of different location within the region, depending on the expression pattern. For example, cropped images for DAPI cycles 2 and 3 below differ in their sampling location.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/IpSNTYOmk9QpFWqRf28xWq-eKgok0mFiJtlP1WVZLKWxJaRHeUQBubMqiaj3wOV5ZiGhA5lY99tBZbg4jxMqfKfTtLbXRAC97K63b67JZK4Dvps72WqnpqKOowxZyg5Z3QTgcc_Z)

(Magenta) A single cycle. (Cyan) Full-resolution cropped image. (Purple) Histogram.

The histogram displays pixel frequency of signal intensities found within the region image. The horizontal intensity axis covers the 16-bit range (0 ~ 65535), while the vertical frequency axis auto-scales to the number of pixels found. Frequency is in logarithmic scale to better represent lower frequencies that correspond to biomarker signal.

Additionally, all cycles except the first contains two histogram plots. All purple plots are of the first cycle, which can be a reference for comparison, especially if the first cycle contains blank cycles. The legend specifies which biomarker the histogram represents.

A summary section contains basic statistics of biomarker region images. Each slide contains four cycles and their corresponding channels. Any non-biomarker channel (i.e. containing "DAPI," "blank" or "empty") will be grayed out.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/k1xa3dbWojRY3n5gmzjZFbQyyLpcQxKeAuNqV3Gn17u_l2dmEzvuBzzk09aYDgRlz-9cTaUvzxUsDJj6-GbC6CgFVT89hjHlvGEX_5GOim5PEd1WSpUiZCIypz93eXlg6v_YU3ta)

There are 18 columns for each channel. All pixel intensities are in 16-bit ranges (0 ~ 65535).

|**Name** |  **Details** |
|--|--|
|  Reg| Region number| 
|  Cyc| Cycle number|
|  Ch| Channel number|
|  Marker| Marker name|
|  Exposure| Exposure time in milliseconds| 
|  Min| Minimum pixel intensity of the region image|
|  Median| Median pixel intensity|
|  95%|95-percentile pixel intensity|
|  Max | Max pixel intensity|
|  Mean| Mean pixel intensity| 
|  Std Dev| Standard deviation|
|  Threshold|Binarization threshold found by Otsu's method|
|  Area| Area of the region image above the threshold (i.e. signal area)|
|  Signal µ| Mean pixel intensity of the area above the threshold (i.e. signal area| 
|  Signal σ| Standard deviation of the signal area|
|  Noise µ| Mean pixel intensity of the area below the threshold (i.e. background area)|
|  Noise σ| Standard deviation of the noisarea|
|  SNR| **Mean of the signal divided by standard deviation of the noise|


These values can be used to assess image quality of each biomarker. As the threshold is not adaptive nor trained, the summary information should be considered within context.

A detailed slide for each marker acquired is also provided. The left-hand side contains image information identical to those shown in the histogram and summary slides.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/461JZ0K3CXEepXS39ihKs_okNvu3Zm6bDZz0gHoD0EQsnOeAytNu71lEErxUiEs3rfx6rylITWXmbq5kXP1hXjj2t5vB-uBfdk7XXDiJgKGOfpbfgIUa0wP_NIYfBY_e8lQEPSRe)
The main image in the center is the region image scaled for best fit and viewing on 4K displays (i.e. scaled to 288 ppi). This image is not in its original resolution and should not be used for detailed analysis.

(Magenta) Image information. (Cyan) Region image. (Purple) Cropped images.

On the right, there are four cropped images displayed in the original, full resolution. Within the whole region, 13 different areas are cropped at full resolution and compared for their intensity standard deviation. The four areas with the highest standard deviations, which often correspond to most contrast and information, are displayed in order.

3.  Open the report and evaluate the channels based on the SNR, intensity patterns etc.
4 ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rQZgGijJ4sLjvXe3xAN515C9MeHsRZx7GH3aVNE_WxT3T5UxThemChfHCC1vxpB01oXYoVGZ1A_4V1A6w2U4pxfV4ZKOlpl-Mis0BiaUAKOjpgLda_cs6MwLZhGy2c4r7LscGacN)
4.  Compare these images to validation staining patterns for the same antibody in the same tissue type. The patterns should follow correct cell type localization for the target marker. Failure is indicated by a FALSE designation in the **channelnames_report.csv** for that specific antibody.
    
5.  Open the generated **channelnames_report.csv** file and add TRUE/FALSE tags to each channel separated with a coma (if using text editors) or to the consecutive column if using *“Excel/LibreOffice”.*
