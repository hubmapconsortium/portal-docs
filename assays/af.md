# HuBMAP Autofluorescence Microscopy (AF)

### Last Updated: 6/15/2020

## Overview: 
This document details AF data states, metadata fields, file structure, QA/QC thresholds, and data processing.

## Description: 
Autofluorescence microscopy exploits endogenous fluorescence in a biological tissue to capture an image. The image can then be used to integrate other images from multiple modalities and to align tissues within a 3D experiment. Autofluorescence microscopy requires no sample preparation and can be performed on any fluorescence microscope.

## Definitions: 
Some terms in this document may not be familiar to all HuBMap users. The following figures illustrate several of these terms:

*Figure 1: Illustration of microscopy terms. The black box represents a slide or cover slip holding the sample. Blue boxes represent “regions” or user defined imaging areas. For instance, one selects a “region” containing a microstructure of interest to be captured in an image. Red boxes represent “tiles” or the microscope “field of view”. The size of a tile is determined by the microscope settings and objective. An imaging region is divided into contiguous tiles.
Because the field of view cannot be changed, tiles will overhang from the region, ensuring the entire region is imaged at the expense of extra tiles being acquired.*

*Figure 2: Images are generally acquired with adjacent tiles overlapping, as indicated by the dark regions in the image on the right above. Overlap enhances alignment of tiles for stitching to create a composite image, as shown in Figure 4 below.*

*Figure 3: Images of tiles are captured as the stage moves across the imaged region row by row (left) or via a serpentine (or snake-like) path (right).*

*Figure 4: Stitching is the process of aligning and merging neighboring image tiles into a single composite image.*

## HuBMAP AF Data States (Levels):
|**Data State** |  **Description**| **Example File Type** | 
|--|--|--|
|  0 | Raw image data: This is the data that comes directly off the microscope without preprocessing; sometimes referred to as tiled or unstitched data. (may not always be included).| CZI, TIFF|
| 1 |  Processed Microscopy data: Can include stitching, thresholding, background subtraction, z-stack alignment, deconvolution |  CZI, TIFF, OME-TIFF|
| 2 |  Segmentation: Computationally predicted cell (nucleus, cytoplasm) and/or structural boundaries (tubules, ventricles, etc.) |  CSV, TIFF|
| 3 |  Annotation (Cells and Structures): Interpretation of microscopy image and/or segmentation in terms of biology (e.g. unhealthy vs healthy, cell-type, function, functional region). |  TIFF, PNG|

|--|--|
|  Intensity| Detector Counts| 
|  Signal| Intensity produced by fluorescence, both endogenous and introduced| 
|  Noise| Intensity not produced by light but electronic fluctuations or electronic background.| 
|  Stitching| Image stitching is the process of combining multiple images (tiles) with overlapping fields of view to produce a single, large image.| 
|  Alignment/Registration| Image registration is the process of transforming different images into one coordinate system. Registration of all channels in each cycle is performed.| 
|  Deconvolution| Deconvolution refers to reversing the optical distortion that takes place in an optical microscope to sharpen images/ improve definition. Practically, deconvolution can also sharpen images that suffer from fast motion or jiggles during capturing.| 
|  Channels| Name of the fluorescence excitation wavelengths used. May be expressed as a fluorophore name (e.g. DAPI, GFP, DsRED, Cy5), wavelength (e.g. 488, 540, 750), or color (e.g. green, red, blue).|
