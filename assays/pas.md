### Last Updated 6/15/2020

## Overview
This document details stained microscopy data states, metadata fields, file structure, QA/QC thresholds, and data processing.

## Description
Stained microscopy employs histological stains such as H&E or PAS to improve resolution and contrast for visualization of physiological structures such as tubules or glomeruli.

## Definitions
There are a variety of terms used in this document that may not be familiar to all researchers wanting to make use of the HubMap data. The following figures illustrate several of these terms:

*Figure 1: Diagram of microscopy terms. The black box represents a slide or cover slip holding the sample. Blue boxes represent “regions” or user-defined imaging areas. For instance, one selects a “region” containing a microstructure of interest to be captured in an image. Red boxes represent “tiles” or the microscope “field of view”. The size of a tile is determined by the microscope settings and objective. An imaging region is divided into contiguous tiles. Because the field of view cannot be changed, tiles will overhang from the region, ensuring the entire region is imaged at the expense of extra tiles being acquired.*

*Figure 2: Images are generally acquired with adjacent tiles overlapping, as indicated by the dark regions in the image on the right above. Overlap enhances alignment of tiles for stitching to create a composite image, as shown in Figure 4 below.*

## HuBMAP Stained Microscopy Data States (Levels)
|**Data State** |  **Description**| **Example File Type** | 
|--|--|--|
|  0 | Raw image data: This is the data that comes directly off the microscope without preprocessing; sometimes referred to as tiled or unstitched data. (may not always be included).| SCN, TIFF|
| 1 |  Processed Microscopy data: Can include stitching, thresholding, background subtraction, z-stack alignment, deconvolution |  CZI, TIFF, OME-TIFF|
| 2 |  Segmentation: Computationally predicted cell (nucleus, cytoplasm) and/or structural boundaries (tubules, ventricles, etc.) |  CSV, TIFF|
| 3 |  Annotation (Cells and Structures): Interpretation of microscopy image and/or segmentation in terms of biology (e.g. unhealthy vs healthy, cell-type, function, functional region). |  TIFF, PNG|

|  Z plane| Plane that determines depth| 
|  Pitch| Distance between pixels| 
|  Tile| Rectangular field-of-view (Figure 1).| 
| Pixel| How close two objects can be and still be differentiated within an image. This is generally dependent upon the diffraction limit of light and the microscope objective.|
